The Playoff Pool Party is a platform where users can create and customize a private league with other users. In a league, users can chat with each other, submit playoff rankings, and compete for points throughout the NFL playoffs (and soon, the NHL and NBA playoffs as well!).


View game scores and league overviews on your dashboard:
